p15140coll30	Aleman Estate (Hathaway Gibbens) Collection	<p>Government-issued postcards first appeared in Austria in 1869 as an economical means of transmitting a message. They swiftly spread throughout Europe and were adopted in the United States in 1873. Meanwhile, pictorial postcards were introduced in France in 1870. Pictorials did not, however, enjoy immediate popularity in the United States, where such privately printed cards required two cents' postage; government postcards cost only a penny. As of July 1, 1898, the Private Mailing Card Act eliminated this inequity, and privately published postcards appeared in increasing number. Postcards published before that date, whether mailed are not, are known as "pioneers".</p><p>The World's Colombian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, led to the emergence of the modern postcard. Charles Goldsmith, a Chicago entrepreneur, obtained from the U.S. Post Office a license to print souvenir views of the fair on government-issued postals. When test sales of four cards met with success, Goldsmith issued sets of ten illustrations packaged in a wrapper. The cards became available in 1892, in time for the exposition's ground-breaking ceremony.</p><p>After the decrease in postage rates in 1893 gave new impetus to the practice of mailing postcards, collecting them became one of the world's most popular hobbies. At first, the Post Office required that one side of the card be given over in its entirety to the recipient's address; any message had to appear on the front with the illustration, necessitating brevity. New regulations issued in 1907 permitted publishers to divide the reverse of the card to accommodate both message and address in a format which remains in use today.The period between 1898 and the outbreak of World War I was the golden age of postcards. Printers in Austria and Germany, where color reproduction was less costly than elsewhere, produced lovely postcards for American publishers. During the fiscal year ending on June 30, 1908, for example, 677,777,798 postcards were mailed in the United States. In addition, vast, uncounted quantities languished, unsent, in collectors' albums. At the time, the population of the United States was 88,700,000.</p><p>Interest in collecting postcards, after reaching the proportion of a national mania for nearly two decades, diminished abruptly in 1914 because of the onset of World War I and the popularity of newfangled folded greeting cards. As a result, postals dating from the 1920s through the 1960s are more scarce than older specimens. Early collectors called their hobby "cartephilia" or "philocarty", Greek for "a hopeless love of cards". A new wave of postcard collecting commenced in the 1970s, indulged in by a visually literate public which discovered them to be attractive souvenirs of travel and leisure activities, compact to store, and convenient for brief messages. To this generation of collectors their avocation is "deltiology", derived from Greek words meaning "small picture" and "knowledge".</p><p>During the golden age of postcard-collecting, one of the collectors was young Anne Hathaway Gibbens, known familiarly as Hathy. As a student of the Ursuline nuns in New Orleans between ca. 1906 and 1910, Hathaway was sent postcards by her mother and other relatives. Hathaway also received postcards, chiefly from friends, at various Gibbens family residences in New Orleans, Louisiana and in Ocean Springs and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. She arranged the cards in albums, supplementing her own acquisitions with a small quantity of postcards addressed to her sister Gladys and to Will J. Gibbens, who presumably was her brother.</p><p>Represented most prominently in Hathaway Gibbens' collection are viewcards, those which depict a building or scene; there are just a few subject cards and no advertising postcards. The largest two series in the collection contain Louisiana and Mississippi scenes. Such postcards became available in the late 1890s. Some provide the earliest color images of small-town and rural sites and structures or the only surviving illustration of a building or an event.</p><p>Browse postcards by series:</p>

p16313coll34	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, LSU Libraries	<p></p><p>View all items in collection.</p><p> </p><p>The Armand Duplantier Family Letters date from 1777 to 1841 and contain items from four generations of the Duplantier family, including Armand Duplantier, his uncle Claude Trénonay,  Armand’s son Armand Allard Duplantier, and granddaughter Amélie Augustine Duplantier Peniston.  The collection’s historical significance lies not only in what it can tell us about the history of Baton Rouge and nearby Pointe Coupée Parish, but also in what it reveals about the state’s colonial period, Francophone Louisiana in the territorial and antebellum era, and the enduring legacy of the state’s French antecedents.</p><p> </p><p>In particular, the letters relate to Louisiana under the French, Spanish, and Americans and the economic, political, and social conditions attendant on transitioning among the three powers; commerce with France; the succession of Trénonay; attitudes about the French Revolution; slavery and plantation matters; family news such as illness, births, deaths, and the education of Duplantier’s children; and travels in France by Amélie Duplantier.</p><p> </p><p>Armand Duplantier, Sr., whose letters represent the bulk of the collection, was born in Voiron, France, in 1753. He served as aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolution and came to Louisiana in 1781 to assist his uncle, Claude Trénonay, in running his plantation in Pointe Coupée Parish.  Soon after his arrival, he married Trénonay’s step-daughter, Augustine.   He continued to manage his uncle’s interests, purchased and sold additional slaves and land in Pointe Coupée, the Felicianas, and the Baton Rouge area, and raised cotton, indigo, and tobacco.  He also developed land holdings in New Orleans, where he lived for a time.  Soon after his wife’s death of yellow fever, in 1802 Duplantier married Constance Rochon Joyce, the widow of John Joyce, the original owner of Magnolia Mound Plantation near Baton Rouge.  Failed crops and poor investments led him to declare bankruptcy in 1814.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to his planting activities, Duplantier was somewhat involved in public life.  His friendship with Lafayette had continued after the Revolution, and when Lafayette was granted lands in Louisiana in 1803 in recognition of his service during the American Revolution, Duplantier was charged with acquiring them.  He was also part of the delegation that welcomed Lafayette during his 1825 visit to Louisiana.   Always concerned about suitable educational opportunities for his own children, he helped establish Baton Rouge College in 1822.  He died five years later and was buried in Highland Cemetery with military honors.</p><p> </p><p>The Armand Duplantier Family Letters were given by the descendants of Guy Antoine Allard Duplantier, elder brother of Armand Duplantier, to their Louisiana cousins, and subsequently donated to the LSU Libraries in 2011.</p><p> </p><p>Transcriptions and translations for this project were prepared by David Laatsch (MLS, LSU 2012), under the supervision and editorship of Special Collections Library Associate in Public Services Germain Bienvenu, PhD.

p16313coll73	Black Natchez	<p>Filmmaker Ed Pincus worked and taught in the 1960s and 70s to develop a direct cinema approach to social and political problems. In 1965, Pincus spent ten weeks in Natchez, Mississippi, filming the lives of ordinary people in the Civil Rights Movement from which he developed two seminal black and white 16mm documentaries. His first film, Black Natchez, telecast on NET Journal, charts early attempts to organize and register Black voters and the formation of a self defense group in the Black community.</p><p>Black Natchez (1967, 62 min.) was shot the week following the murder of Wharlest Jackson, the treasurer of the Natchez branch of the NAACP. Jackson had been working in the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Plant, and had recently been promoted to a position that had been previously held by white workers. On the evening of February 27, 1965, a bomb detonated in Jackson’s pickup truck and killed him. He had received threats at the plant, and the incident highlighted the continued presence of the Ku Klux Klan in Natchez. In the week that followed, the African American community, along with local and national civil rights activists, gathered to address the problem. What Pincus captured were the protest marches, community meetings, and general public sentiment following Jackson’s death. The rolls of film he shot are genuine, often candid, portrayals of a community in a time of turmoil. At times, Pincus and his partner, David Neuman, turn the camera on an individual and interview him. Interviewees range from prominent civil rights leaders, including Charles Evers, to more representative residents, and they are asked to express his or her thoughts and feelings about racial tensions and violence in the city. The film also chronicles the tensions between the NAACP and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, both of which were operating in Natchez.</p>
p16313coll39	Bourbon Street, 1944-1952	<p>The Southeastern Architectural Archive, Tulane University Libraries, is home to the Walter Cook Keenan New Orleans Photographs Collection numbering over 3,000 images. Walter Cook Keenan (1881-1970), the first architect of the Vieux Carré Commission (VCC) and a lifelong member of the Audubon Park Commission, took the photographs in order to document changes to the built environment. In 2013, the Tulane Digital Library undertook to digitize the portion of the collection focused on historic Bourbon Street. </p><p>Bourbon Street underwent significant changes during the mid-twentieth century. Beginning in 1944, the VCC increasingly sought to regulate the appearance of building facades, especially by limiting signage and prohibiting the use of neon. As VCC architect, Keenan conducted daily property inspections to document Vieux Carré Ordinance violations. Entertainment businesses along Bourbon Street were notably affected by the ordinance and Keenan recorded nearly every property along the artery more than once. Bourbon Street's night clubs, jazz musicians, burlesque shows, restaurants and boarding houses became his photographic subjects. The collection includes images of Sloppy Joe's, Lenny Gale's Sugar Bowl, the Old Barn Bar, Zonia's Cocktail Lounge, Ciro's, the Magic Lock, the Famous Door, 418 Bar, Dixie's Bar of Music, and Stormy's Casino Royale. Signs for burlesque dancers Evangeline, Bubbles, Kalantan, Pam Holloway, and Stormy's Mother also feature prominently.</p>

p15140coll25	Charity Hospital Reports	<p> The history of Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana begins on May  10, 1736.  On that date, the first Charity Hospital,  funded by the estate of shipbuilder Jean Louis, opened in a house on  Chartres and Bienville Streets in the historic French Quarter  to serve the city's poor and indigent population.  Since that time,  Charity Hospital has moved from location to location around  the city due to fire, flood, and politics.  Charity Hospital's last  location, the 1939 Art-Deco style complex located on Tulane Avenue  in New Orleans, Louisiana, has remained unused since Hurricane Katrina  in August of 2005. </p><p></p><p> The responsibility of Charity Hospital was assumed by the State of  Louisiana on March 17, 1813, almost one year after Louisiana was granted   statehood in 1812. Charity Hospital produced regular reports for the  state government of Louisiana titled Report(s) of the Board of  Administrators of the Charity Hospital to the General Assembly of Louisiana, also known as the Charity Hospital Reports.    Published from 1842 to 1974, these reports are vital to Louisiana's  social and medical history and include information not widely available  from the nineteenth century. The Charity Hospital Reports include  public health information on morbidity and mortality (including  information on the yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans), venereal  disease issues, disease incidence, vital statistics, and hospital  administration.  The reports also have information on the governance and financing of the  hospital. Medical milestones and memorials are sometimes included.  The reported information varies from year to year, but generally there  is a report to the legislature with a statistical report of the diseases   treated in the hospital.   Names of administrators, physicians,  surgeons, residents, internes and donors to the hospital are included in  most reports.  Most of the Charity Hospital Reports were published in English, but some early reports were also published in French.  The 1853 and 1856 Reports are the only years scanned in the French version). The Charity Hospital Reports Collection is a valuable  historic tool for researchers with a wide range of interests from  medical history to the importance of Charity Hospital as both a social  and cultural  institution in the New Orleans area.  All of the reports were published  as documents of the State of Louisiana and therefore are in the public  domain. </p><p></p><p> The John P. Isché Library at Louisiana State University Health Sciences  Center in New Orleans supplemented the Rudolph Matas Library content by  providing replacement copies for scanning as needed to replace damaged  or missing content. The documents are available as .pdf documents with  the  text fully searchable.  Every attempt has been made to make these  documents accessible according to guidelines and standards for Section  508. </p><p></p><p> The Charity Hospital Reports have been digitized by the Rudolph Matas Library of the Health Sciences of Tulane University under a NLM grant  awarded August 2010-June 2011 for a project titled: Early Medical Journalism of Louisiana, A pilot project for the preservation and sharing of  Nineteenth Century Medical Publications of Louisiana [National Library of Medicine (NLM) Prime Contract No. N01-LM-6-3505; HHSN276200663505C]. </p><p></p><p> See also the Matas Library website: Tulane and Charity Hospital: http://matas.tulane.edu/about/tulaneandcharity </p><p></p><p> For more information on the history of Charity Hospital: </p><p></p><p> Matas, Rudolph, and John Duffy.

Booth Collection (MSS 292) at the Earl K. Long Library at the University of New Orelans. Only photos from "Series III Visual Materials, Subseries III.1 Photographs of trucks" are included. Due to potential copyright restrictions, these scans must be viewed on campus.</p><p> </p><p>HISTORICAL NOTE</p><p> </p><p>The first organized Mardi Gras truck parade in New Orleans followed Rex down Canal Street on March 5, 1935, when fifty-six different groups riding on decorated trucks banded together to form the Elks Krewe of Orleanians.  Many of the participants were members of fraternities, sororities, neighborhood social clubs, and schools.  In addition to the Elks trucks, numerous other decorated trucks were sponsored by independent carnival clubs, for a total of nearly one hundred vehicles in the first truck parade. In New Orleans, street celebrations have commemorated Mardi Gras at least since February 24, 1857, when the Mistick Krewe of Comus held its inaugural parade.  The routes of the major parades included St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street, Royal Street, and other principal streets in downtown New Orleans and the French Quarter.  After World War I, some maskers, who had theretofore celebrated as they walked and danced through the streets, formed groups to ride on home-decorated trucks of various description.  The parade routes were heavily policed, however, and the trucks were not permitted to parade on major streets.  As time passed, the number of trucks and the quality of their decoration increased, and something of a competition burgeoned among the truck groups.  By the late 1920s and early 1930s, decorations were becoming increasingly elaborate. After riding on a decorated truck sponsored by the local Lodge #30 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in 1933, Chris R. Valley conceived the idea of organizing the independent trucks into a parade which would follow Rex on the established parade route.  On September 6, 1934, an Elks Carnival Committee was formed within the lodge, with Valley as its chairman.  On January 18, 1935, the group began publicizing the plan in the newspaper.  Given impetus by local columnists such as Mel Washburn and F. Edward Hebert, by the Elks committee, and by the general enthusiasm for Carnival, the idea caught on, and the Elks Krewe of Orleanians was born.  Valley, who remained active with the group for thirty years, gathered many of the materials in the collection. As time passed, the Elks Krewe of Orleanians grew, generally sponsoring forty-five to one hundred trucks annually from 1935 to 1955, one hundred fifty trucks through 1965, one hundred eighty trucks through 1971, and one hundred fifty trucks since 1971.  In 1946, Russell Calonge formed the Krewe of Crescent City, a parade of fifty to seventy-five trucks which follows the Elks Krewe of Orleanians.  Two additional truck parades began in the mid-1970s to follow the Krewe of Argus parade in Metairie, Louisiana (Jefferson Parish): the Krewe of Jefferson, founded by William H. Aitken, and the Elks Krewe of Jeffersonians, sponsored by B.P.O.E. Lodge #30.  Together they contribute some one hundred trucks, and the Elks Krewe of Gretna on the West Bank provides about sixty-five more.  Another dozen or so trucks follow the Krewe of St. Bernard parade in St. Bernard Parish.  Each truck is sponsored by an individual carnival club consisting of ten to fifteen families.  On average, forty persons ride on each truck. Maskers riding on trucks are known for the generosity with which they toss favors, known as “throws,” into the crowds of spectators.  This custom began during the earliest Mardi Gras celebrations with the throwing of foodstuffs, candies, and cookies, and evolved into today’s assortment of beads, plastic toys and cups, and doubloons.  The last of these, a 1½”, lightweight aluminum medallion, was originated by H. Alvin Sharpe.  First used by Rex in 1960, doubloons had spread by 1963 to the truck parades.  The first truck doubloon was a ceramic disc distributed by the Verbenas Carnival Club, followed in 1964 by a wooden nickel thrown by the Trabs Carnival Club.  Beginning in 1965, truck doubloons proliferated so rapidly that by 1969, some one hundred seventeen trucks out of a total of two hundred seventy in Greater New Orleans were throwing their own truck doubloons.  By 1969, however, interest in truck doubloons was diminishing.  During their glory years, however, some two hundred twenty carnival clubs were responsible for the minting of three thousand different medallions, for a total of more than twenty-five million truck doubloons. The collection was donated to the Earl K.

LSU_CNP	Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park Photographs	<p></p><p> </p><p>The Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was the first and largest military park in the United States. The park was officially dedicated in September 1895. The Louisiana Commission (or Committee) created the images in the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park collection after the Louisiana and National Commissioners established the official points of interest. The Park contains approximately 8,190 acres of land divided among several areas in Tennessee and Georgia. The collection contains twenty-nine (29) albumen photoprints of the grounds of the Park, taken circa 1894. There are eight (8) photographs from Missionary Ridge (Tenn. and Ga.) and twenty-one (21) photographs from Chickamauga (Ga.). The physical collection can be viewed at Louisiana State University's Hill Memorial Library.</p>
p15140coll10	Civil War Context and Conflict at LSU Libraries	<p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On April 12, 1861, the first shots rang from Fort Sumter, sparking what would become the most devastating conflict ever fought in North America. The American Civil War (1861-1865) played out in over 10,000 settings across the American landscape, taking the lives of more than 600,000 soldiers. The war was a watershed moment in the nation’s history, ushering in a new economic, social and political order, leaving behind slavery and a planter aristocracy in the South, and ensuring that American democracy and free labor would survive both in the East and in the new states of the West. </p><p> </p><p> The Louisiana State University Libraries’ Division of Special Collections, housed in Hill Memorial Library, offers researchers a rich collection of materials relating to the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction periods. The majority of these sources are part of the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections (LLMVC), which boast extensive holdings of books, periodicals, maps, manuscripts, state documents, and microfilm that support scholarly research in many areas, including religion, plantation management, slavery, French Creole identity and relations, and Southern nationalism. </p><p> </p><p> In conjunction with the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL)-sponsored collaborative digital project, "Civil War in the American South" marking the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, LSU’s Special Collections staff has digitized 150 items from the LLMVC and Rare Book Collections. The materials chosen were included as illustrations of the ideological, political, and cultural origins of the Civil War. With historical themes ranging from Southern culture and a developing sectional identity, race relations, and gender to plantation life and politics in the years 1850-1865, the digital collection provides context for secession and the war itself. </p><p> Both published and unpublished materials were selected.</p><p> </p><p> View All Unpublished Items: </p><p> Unpublished manuscript items relate to education in the South, particularly the early history of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning (present day Louisiana State University) immediately before and during the early years of the Civil War; racial attitudes, slavery, plantation management, and the transition from slavery to free labor; family, social life and customs; literature and reading, especially the need for southern-produced works; developing southern nationalism; religion in daily life; and men and women’s attitudes toward secession, politics, and the war. Additional materials include the diary kept by C.S.A. soldier John E. Ellis while a prisoner of war, selected letters of Eugène Dumez regarding Confederate diplomacy in France, and a series of letters from publisher and promoter of Southern commerce J.D.B. De Bow to Louisiana author and politician Charles Gayarré that focus on party politics, the Confederacy, and slavery.</p><p></p><p> Published Items:  </p><p> These sources are strong in topics relating to education, science and the arts in antebellum Louisiana. The diverse group of materials also includes rare sheet music relating to the Civil War and Louisiana. French-language poetry reflecting the state’s French and Creole roots is also available.</p>

Since the first Gulf South Field Survey in 2011, fellows and staff of the Classical Institute of the South (CIS) have cataloged over 1,000 objects in private collections dating from the 18th century through the Civil War. The survey spans Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and we are continually expanding our reach throughout the region. </p><p> </p><p>So far, the Gulf South Field Study has only scratched the surface of the rich cultural material that survives in the region. In addition to expanding into new physical areas, the CIS also seeks to explore new material evidence of the cultural diversity represented in the Gulf South. As cataloging efforts continue, new information and images will be added to this database in order to draw attention to the objects and to the research possibilities that they present. </p><p> </p><p>Such an undertaking would not be possible without the cooperation of willing homeowners and institutional partners. The CIS is pleased to participate in the active cultural community of the Gulf South region along with collaborators such as The Historic New Orleans Collection, the Louisiana State Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the LSU Museum of Art in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the Historic Natchez Foundation in Natchez, Mississippi, and others.  </p><p> </p><p>The Historic New Orleans Collection has provided advisory and technical support throughout the project, and hosts the database as part of its contributions to the Louisiana Digital Library.</p><p> </p><p>Visit the Classical Institute of the South's website for news on the progress of the project, highlighted objects, and information on how to get involved. </p><p> </p><p>Browse all items in the collection</p>

Tate (1894-1963), a 1917 graduate of West Point and a field artillery officer who served in both World Wars, was commanding officer of the Louisiana military district in 1950.  A photograph album that belonged to him comprises this digital collection.</p><p>  </p><p>The album, now unbound, contains 103 black and white prints mounted on paper.  The images show scenes from several locations in Louisiana during the 1920s, including Baton Rouge, New Orleans, St. Martinville, Morgan City, Avery Island, and Franklin.  The New Orleans images show scenes of Mardi Gras, The Vieux Carré, buildings, and architectural details.  There are also photos of Bayous scenes, particularly Bayou Teche.  Children and wildlife appear in some of the photos.  In addition, there is a group of logging industry images showing workers, roads, and equipment.  Another group of photos was taken along Louisiana coastal areas and depicts oyster and shrimp fishermen, their boats, nets, camps, activities, and families.</p><p> </p><p>View Collection Finding Aid</p><p> </p>
p16313coll53	Cole Coleman Photographs	<p>The collection consists of gelatin silver prints made by New Orleans photographer Howard “Cole” Coleman (1883-1969) and donated to Tulane University in memory of his wife, Thelma Hecht Coleman. Most images represent Coleman’s professional work in Louisiana; a smaller number consists of copy-stand images taken from historic documents. Most predate his wife’s death in August 1963. </p><p>As a commercial photographer, Coleman specialized in local subjects developed in series. His photographs have a documentary quality since his darkroom work relied primarily on enlargements and cropping. The collection thus includes straight photographs and corresponding negatives of visiting celebrities, jazz musicians, notable structures, festival culture, restaurants, wildlife and foreign trade operations.</p><p>By the late 1950s and influenced by his wife, Coleman focused on the region’s historic architecture, especially rural plantations and Vieux Carré buildings. He took an interest in documenting the same subjects over the course of time, photographing buildings before and after renovations or other significant changes. He used the same approach with his commercial Mardi Gras images, situating his camera in two locations along major parade routes to systematically photograph passing float processions. Gallier Hall (545 St. Charles Street) and the Keller-Zander building (814 Canal Street) typically form the backdrop to his these images.</p><p>Notable amongst his non-architectural series are time-based and aerial photographs. Two separate series of negative images record the sequences of activities associated with Algiers “poor boy” bread-making and Bayou Barataria shrimping. Two series of aerial photographs document trade operations along the Mississippi River, one centered on the Industrial Canal at North Claiborne Avenue and the other on the International Foreign Trade Zone. Wharf productivity is emphasized, with steamers, tugboats, stevedores and exports featuring prominently.</p><p>A smaller group of images document celebrities in New Orleans. He photographed First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and military aviators Eddie Rickenbacker and Claire Lee Chennault. He recorded Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald’s appearances at a New Orleans Muscular Dystrophy benefit and Dorothy Lamour’s 1956 Mardi Gras participation. His images of Denise Darcel (1924-2011) clowning with floats in the Rex den coincided with a period in which the French-American actress was regularly performing in New Orleans theatres and night clubs. The Famous Door, the Paddock Lounge, and Alphonse Picou’s St. Claude Avenue funeral drew his attention to local musicians, although this was not a mainstay of his professional work.</p>

p16313coll63	The Crescent City Pictorial	<p>In 1926, former school teacher and newspaper publisher O.C.W. (Orlando Capitola Ward) Taylor published a 28-page souvenir booklet dedicated "to the Progress of the Colored Citizens of New Orleans, Louisiana, "America's Most Interesting City." The Crescent City Pictorial was designed by O.T. Griffin and featured the photography of Villard Paddio. This largely visual publication featured images of African American homes, businesses, schools, churches, and social organizations, and serves as one of the best visual documents of African American life in early 20th century New Orleans.</p><p> </p><p>Businesses include the United Industrial Life Insurance Company, Carr & Llopis Undertakers, Dorsey's Valeteria, Flint-Goodridge Hospital, Geddes & Moss Undertaking and Embalming, George D.

LSU_DYP	Donn Young Photographs	<p></p><p> </p><p>Donn Young began his professional photographer's life over 30 years ago. His work has appeared in Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, and many other publications. In addition to his studio and commercial work, he became the official photographer of the Port of New Orleans in 1996.Donn's entire life's work was in his Lakeview studio and home when the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina rose in 2005. Unreachable for weeks, his home and studio were submerged, drained, and submerged again, with the collection left to mold and ruin in a witches' brew of brackish water, sewage, petroleum products, and other compounds while efforts to drain the city got underway.The LSU Libraries Special Collections managed to salvage 32,645 images portraying a wide range of images from New Orleans, Louisiana, and beyond. Images include people, art, music, theater, plants, food, buildings, views, manners and customs, religion and culture, education, medicine, business, industry and transportation, Associations and Institutions, Publications, sports, and portfolios.</p>

p15140coll45	Essai d'Anatomie	<p>The Essai D'Anatomie was produced by Gautier D'Agoty in 1745 in  Paris, France.  It is a remarkably detailed atlas of the head, neck,  and shoulder areas of the human body with explanatory text in French.  The anatomical images were based on human cadavers dissected by Joseph  Duverney (1) and produced using the mezzotint method of engraving and  printing. </p><p> </p><p>Mezzotint color engraving printing was invented by Jaques Christophe Le Blon in 1719.  Mezzotint (from the Italian phrase mezza tina or half tone)  prints are produced by engraving a metal plate with numerous small  holes that hold ink.  When used to make a print, the engraved plate  produces large areas of subtle shaded color tones.  Since the mezzotint  technique is quite labor-intensive, it fell out of favor by the 20th  century, although it is still utilized by some artists.  Most often used  to reproduce paintings by famous artists, mezzotint printing was rarely  used for original works of art (2), making the Essai D'Anatomie a work of great scientific and artistic significance.</p><p> </p><p>The original copy of the Essai D'Anatomie held by the Rudolph  Matas Library of the Health Sciences at Tulane University was restored,  bound, and digitized by William Kitchens.  The restoration work was  completed on May 6, 2008.  These remarkable anatomical images from the  18th century provide a fascinating look into both the artistic and  scientific climate of the period.</p><p> </p><p> References: </p><p></p><p>1.

p15140coll46	Fonville Winans’ Aerial Views of Baton Rouge	<p></p><p> </p><p>Baton Rouge experienced the onset of rapid growth in the post-World War II years: a number of housing developments were built, in one case as a result of modified war-era pre-fabricated building production facilities; businesses expanded on their existing sites or built new sites; new public, private, and parochial schools rose, and; a new public hospital went up.</p><p>Baton Rouge photographer Fonville Winans shot at least thirteen rolls of 35mm black & white film in 1947 between the months of February and June, inclusive, from his small private airplane. Information in his shot log indicates he intended to sell copies of the images to businesses documented in the images. Fonville noted in the shot log which images sold and which did not, though we have no definitive proof if these notations are complete.This digital collection consists of two series. The first series  is six (6) two-sided ledger book pages listing each of twelve (12) flights with some additional information associated with each frame of the roll of film shot during that flight. Every frame does not necessarily have an associated identification. One additional roll of aerial photographs not listed in the shot log is included in this collection.The second series contains a total of four hundred fifty seven (457) digital reproductions of the 35mm black & white exposures created during the flights listed above. A small number of the original exposures were unusable.For the most part, Fonville flew along the most developed streets in Baton Rouge such as Plank Road, Scenic Highway, Choctaw Street, Florida Street, and Florida Boulevard. He occasionally flew over and photographed areas that were being developed in 1947, such as the Melrose Subdivision – just north of Florida Boulevard and east of North Foster Drive – and the area near the intersection of Florida Boulevard and Airline Highway, which, in 1947, was an “open” area on the verge of development. One roll is entirely devoted to images of the current Louisiana State University campus and vicinity.There are no physical, positive prints of these negatives.Of particular note is the Crawford Homes development in Delmont Place. W. Hamilton Crawford arrived in Baton Rouge in 1941 to start a company that made prefabricated barracks and hospitals for the U. S. war effort.  Following the war, Crawford turned to developing pre-fabricated home subdivisions in Louisiana and elsewhere. Delmont Place is located less than 1 mile southwest of the intersection of Airline Highway and Plank Road bounded by Riley Street (north), Plank Road (east), Shelly Street (south) and, Douglas Avenue (west).Additional new housing developments pictured within this collection are: the Concrete House Project in the Belfair Homes subdivision bounded by Choctaw Drive (north), Martin Avenue (east), Washington Avenue (south), and North 38th Street (west), and; Rittiner Drive housing project built between McGrath Avenue (north), Eugene Street (east), Myrtle Avenue (south), and St Rose Avenue (west). Olive Street and Rittiner Drive pass through the quadrangle described by the streets named above.The campus of Louisiana State University, seeing an influx of World War Two veterans utilizing the benefits of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights), put up war surplus “hutments” just off campus on Nicholson Drive to house married students. Hutments were also installed on campus for faculty housing.New housing was also going in around the City Park, Erie, and University Lakes. Many of these homes were being built by Standard Oil Company (now ExxonMobil) management and other prominent businessmen.It is important to know that a number of changes have taken place in Baton Rouge between 1947 and 2012 when the collection was processed. The most import of those changes in relationship to this collection is two-fold: 1) Street numbering changed as density increased, and; 2) Streets changed names and in some cases ceased to exist.Where possible, image location identifications were created and verified using the following resources:•    city directories for 1947, 1948, and 1949;•    a street map published in 1947, and;•    Google maps.Given the changes in street numbering and street names, anyone using this collection to identify a site using only its current address may not be able to do so. This is especially true regarding the numbering of the homes along East and South Lake Shore Drives and businesses along Florida Street, Florida Boulevard, Government Street, and other streets and avenues paralleling these main streets.In 1947, North 21st Street between Main Street and Choctaw Street continued as such to Choctaw Street. Today, that portion of North 21st Street between Main Street and Choctaw Street has been renamed as a continuation of Scenic Highway. Also in 1947, there was as yet no Acadian Thruway. The following streets, from north to south, were incorporated into Acadian Thruway at some point:•    North 33rd Street from Mohican to Choctaw Drive;•    North 33rd and 34th Streets between Choctaw Drive and North Street;•    Kernan and Margaretta Avenues from North Street to North Boulevard;•    Oakwood Drive from North Boulevard to Government Street; •    Westmoreland Drive from Government Street to Clay Cut Road, and;•    Cleon Avenue from Clay Cut Road to Hundred Oaks Avenue.From Hundred Oaks Avenue south a new road connector was eventually constructed to tie Acadian Thruway into Stanford Avenue. To find an address currently given as Acadian Thruway will require knowing the cross streets between which the building is located. If the current address is on that section of the Thruway between Hundred Oaks Avenue and Stanford Avenue it will not be in this collection as that section of the Thruway did not exist in 1947.Copyright is retained by descendants of the creators in accordance with U.S. copyright law.

FBM	Frank B. Moore Collection	<p>Collection Description</p><p>Frank B. Moore (1869-1957) was a commercial photographer in New Orleans from 1896 until his death on January 21, 1957. Born in Sauk Center, Minnesota, Moore learned his trade in Milwaukee working with the noted photographer Simon Leonard Stein. He had various studios during his sixty-seven year career in New Orleans, including 1008 Canal St. (1896-99), 147 Baronne St. (1900-02), 1001 St. Charles Ave. (1903-06), 1700 St. Charles Ave. (1907-14); 114 ½ Baronne (1915-20); and 1317 Tulane Ae. (1923-58). For a brief time in the mid-920s he also managed a film studio called "Crescent Comedies." Moore married Elizabeth (Bessie) Meade, sister of British artist Sir Arthur Meade, and they had two children: Frank B. (Sonny) Moore, Jr., and Gladys Renya Moore. At various times the whole family was involved in the business. Bessie worked before their marriage as a "retoucher", as president and secretary of the business after they married, and photographer after her husband retired. Frank, Jr., worked as a photographer for a time in the 1930s, while Gladys served as a frequent model for her father, winning many beauty contests in the 1920s, including "Miss New Orleans" in 1926. After Bessie retired, Gladys Moore continued the business until 1972.</p><p>The Frank Moore Collection contains nearly 550 negatives, most of them glass plates, taken from 1915 to 1950. Well over half of the collection consists of individual and group portraits, many featuring performers in costume, musicians, and local schools. The remaining images are of local industrial or commercial subjects and outdoor scenes. The photographs cover all aspects of New Orleans history and culture and offer a rich insight into the fashions, work, landmarks and leisure of the city during these important years.</p><p>(Source: New Orleans States, August 31, 1902; New Orleans Times-Picayune, January 23, 1957; New Orleans City Directories, 1896-1958)</p><p></p><p>Browse All Items in This Collection</p><p>Browse by Subject Terms:</p><p>Browse by Terms in Title:</p><p>To refine your search, click "Advanced Search" at the top of the page.</p>

Many of these extend, chronologically, beyond the end of slavery. Being a free person of color ceased to have legal meaning after emancipation and the passage of the 13th Amendment, but having been a member of that class continued to have cultural, racial, social, economic, and political implications for those who had been free people of color in the antebellum period, and for generations of their descendants. For this reason, we have chosen to digitize  entire collections and not set an arbitrary cut-off date for materials.</p><p> </p><p>Because of the relative dearth lack of personal and family papers for free people of color, public records are a particularly important source for researchers. This project will digitize significant collections of public records  from the New Orleans Public Library’s Louisiana Division, including a  four-volume “Register of free persons of color entitled to remain in the state”  (1840-1864), four different collections of emancipation records, which often  include testimony regarding why the slave was deserving of freedom and provide other information about the slave and slave owner, and an extensive collection of indenture records (1809-1843) in which at least one participant (the person being indentured, his/her sponsor, or the artisan/merchant to whom the servant was being bound) was a free person of color.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, many items have been selected for digitization from larger collections that are not primarily related to free  people of color. Bringing these items together from the disparate collections in which they exist will facilitate comparison and help to provide a larger body of information for researchers about the norms of living conditions and race relations for free people of color during the colonial and antebellum eras. </p><p> </p><p></p>

loyno-p16313coll20	Germany’s Wild Medicinal Plants (Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen)	<p>Monroe Library’s Special Collections and Archives is proud to display reproductions from one of the most beautiful volumes in our collection, Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen by German botanist Johann Gottlieb Mann. Published in 1828, Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen (Germany’s Wild Medicinal Plants) contains hand-colored lithographs of medical plants, flowers, and fruits. Following the illustrations is the Latin name and German description for each plant. </p><p>In the introduction to the volume, Mann states that his goal in publishing the work was two-fold: to present a collection of realistic drawings of medicinal plants for the use of doctors, veterinarians and pharmacists who would not otherwise have the time or opportunity to study the plants in nature, and to give a simple and precise description of the plants along with where they may be found and when they are in season. Mann’s illustrations transcend their original, utilitarian purpose of assisting medical professionals, however; they are works of art.</p><p>This digital collection includes selections of illustrations from the book.

He began his American career with several teaching posts throughout the Northeast before becoming the first teacher of piano and composition of the Tulane University Music Department (formerly the Sophie Newcomb College). He held this post until his death in 1928. As one of the founding faculty members, Ferrata’s influence on the early growth and development of the music department was substantial. During his career as an educator, Ferrata continued to compose music which won recognition at several competitions including the Music Teachers’ National Association Competition (1897), the Sonzogna Opera Competition of Milan (1903), and the Art Society of Pittsburgh Competition (1908). Though largely forgotten today, Ferrata’s works were generally well-received and performed across the United States during Ferrata’s lifetime.This collection includes more than 30 works published between 1901 and 1921. His versatility as a composer is highlighted by the variety of genres present in the collection; from light songs to solo piano works, masses, and string quartets.

p15140coll18	Hermann Moyse, Sr. World War I Collection	<p>The Hermann Moyse, Sr., Letters contain letters written by Hermann Moyse, Sr. (1891-1985), a native of St. Gabriel, LA, during his time as a soldier in World War I. The letters are primarily addressed to Rosalie Gottlieb, Moyse's future wife. The collection also contains letters from Moyse to his parents, Simon and Flora Moyse, and siblings, as well as letters from various friends and fellow soldiers. Moyse earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in 1910 and a Bachelor of Law degree in 1912, after which he worked for the law firm of Cross and Moyse in Baton Rouge. Gottlieb, a Baton Rouge native, and daughter of Joseph and Rebecca (Hahn) Gottlieb, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from LSU in 1918.</p><p> </p><p>Moyse was one of the first volunteers from Louisiana to join the World War I effort, enlisting in the Army's First Officers Training Camp in 1917. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Moyse was deployed to the Alsace sector, where he was severely wounded in trench warfare during the Aisne-Marne offensive on July 21, 1918. After months of convalescence, he returned to active duty as the assistant to the adjutant general of the Service of Supply at Tours, France. Moyse was honorably discharged in 1919 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart, and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. Upon returning to Louisiana he was promoted to captain in the Reserve Corps of the United States Army. Moyse was active in local patriotic groups and during World War II served as state commander of the Louisiana Department of the American Legion.</p><p> </p><p>Moyse and Gottlieb married on September 30, 1920. The couple had two children, Hermann, Jr., and Betty. From 1921 to 1924, Moyse represented East Baton Rouge Parish in the state legislature. He worked as an attorney for the City National Bank in Baton Rouge from its inception in 1933 and became its vice-president and trust officer in 1946. He also served in various capacities with the Chamber of Commerce, the Red Cross, and other civic groups.</p><p> </p><p>The letters cover the period Moyse spent at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas, Camp MacArthur in Waco, TX, as well as his brief stay in New York before he left for France. The majority of the letters are from his time in France, during which he writes to Gottlieb about his experiences with his fellow soldiers as well as his interaction with French people he encountered during his deployment. Moyse writes fondly of the French, for whom he has a great admiration of their stoic nature in a time of grave crisis and hardship.</p>
HIC	Higgins Industries	<p>Collection Description</p><p> </p><p>For nearly thirty years, the boat building company founded by Andrew Jackson Higgins was an important fixture in New Orleans. What began as a sideline to the petroleum industry in 1930 soon developed into a thriving commercial concern.  Higgins specialized in shallow-draft boats suitable to the bayous of Louisiana.  With World War II that reputation enabled Higgins Industries to become one of the largest manufacturers of U. S. naval combat boats during World War II.  The ability of the company to design and produce vessels in record time meant that during the war they produced 20,094 boats, employing 20,000 workers at seven plants in the New Orleans area.  Their most famous vehicles were the landing craft used during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, which prompted General Eisenhower to remark that Andrew Higgins "won the war for us."</p><p> </p><p>The diagrams in this collection are of Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB), better  known as PT boats, which formed a major part of the company's war  effort.  From 1939-1945 the U. S. Navy purchased or contracted for 808  of these boats, generally in squadron-sized groups of twelve.  Of these,  Higgins Industries built or contracted to deliver 221: Nos. 5-6, 70,  and 564 (Hellcat) were prototypes; 71-94; 197-254; 265-313; 450-485;  625-660; and 791-802 were series, or "classes" of contracts.  The  contracts for Nos. 797-808 were cancelled in the latter half of 1945 and  these boats were never completed.  Most of the plans in this collection  applied either to an entire class (designated by the number of the  first boat in each group: e.g. Series 265; Series 450; Series 625), or a  subset thereof (e.g. 199-210).</p><p> </p><p>Browse All Items in the Higgins Collection</p><p> </p><p>Browse by Keyword</p><p> </p><p>To refine your search, click "Advanced Search" at the top of the page.</p>

Miss Reid was the first public health nurse in Calcasieu Parish and established several free clinics for the poor. In addition to her work in public health, Reid served as the unofficial historian of Lake Charles, collecting photographs, postcards, pamphlets, and clippings into scrapbooks. Today her materials give researchers insight into daily life in Lake Charles in the early 1900s. Photographs in the collection also document major events in the area's history, including the Great Fire of 1910, the 1918 Hurricane, Prohibition rallies, and Hurricane Audrey. Other photographs follow the history of McNeese State University, from its inception in 1939 to the present.

TAHIL providers include the Louisiana State Archives,  Louisiana State Museum, The Historic New Orleans Collection and Tulane  Univers ity Library Special Collections. </p><p></p><p>The Huey Long Digital Collection  contains original documents concerning depression-era Louisiana and  detailing Huey P. Long's "Share Our Wealth" program.   From the Historic  New Orleans Collection, a variety of original broadsides and speeches  offer insight into the popular appeal of Long's Louisiana program.  Sample ballots and election posters from Tulane's Special Collections  document Long's bid for public office.  In personal correspondence, also  from Tulane's Special Collections, Long compares his efforts to enact  "old age" pensions with FDR's efforts at the national level.   Transportation maps provided by the Louisiana State Museum illustrate  the results of Long's massive road-building program.  Opposition to  Long's programs is documented by newspaper articles, broadsides and  legislative appeals sponsored by a variety of Louisiana political and  economic groups including Standard Oil and the Louisiana Women's  Committee.  Of particular note, from THNOC manuscript holdings, a couple  of letters from author Ezra Pound related to Long's death speak to the  worldwide implications of this event and perceptions that Long's views  that were progressive and important. A compilation of Long's speeches is  also a part of the digital record being offered by THNOC and Tulane  University Library's Special Collections. </p>

p120701coll29	Isidore Newman School Archives	<p>Collection Description</p><p> Isidore Newman School is an independent, co-educational, college preparatory school located in uptown New Orleans. The school was founded in 1903 with the gift of local philanthropist Isidore Newman, who wanted to provide a superior education to the boys and girls living in the nearby Jewish Orphans Home. The school employed an education method called manual training, and was therefore called Isidore Newman Manual Training School, or "Manual". Its motto is Discimus Agere Agendo, or "We learn to do by doing". The initial curriculum combined academics with training in wood and iron work, sewing, cooking, and household management. Newman stipulated that the school be open to all children regardless of religion or social background. By 1931 the school had become college preparatory and changed its name to Isidore Newman School.</p><p></p><p>Isidore Newman School's archives span over one hundred years and contain materials historically significant to the history of New Orleans, the Manual Training Movement in education, and to the story of immigrants finding prosperity in America, a central theme in our country's history.</p><p> </p><p>The archives contain relics and photographs relating to Isidore Newman, his wife, Rebecca Kieffer Newman, and their descendants. There are student publications such as the Pioneer and the Greenie, the former of which was founded in 1911 and is the oldest continuously published student magazine in Louisiana. During the Pioneer's early years, students carved wood blocks in art class to decorate the covers; they have survived and are works of art in themselves. The archives also contain the usual memorabilia of a school: sepia photographs of students wearing sweaters embroidered with the "M" for Manual, graduation pictures, homecoming programs, invitations, snapshots of class trips, scrapbooks, old report cards, readers, primers, and diplomas.</p>

p15140coll31	Judge John Minor Wisdom Collection	<p>John Minor Wisdom (1905-1999) was hailed as "a giant among federal judges during the tumultuous years that saw official segregation end in the South and civil rights at last extended to black Americans." Born in New Orleans, he attended Isidore Newman School and graduated from Washington and Lee University. In 1925 Wisdom went to Harvard University to study English literature, but a year later he returned to New Orleans and entered Tulane University Law School. He graduated first in his class in 1929 and was admitted to the bar. Later he and a former classmate, Saul Stone, founded the law firm which eventually became Stone, Pigman, Walther, Wittman and Hutchinson. While in private practice, he distinguished himself as an expert on trusts and was largely responsible for the adoption of Louisiana's new trust code.</p><p>During World War II, Wisdom served as a captain in the Army and later as lieutenant colonel in the Office of Legal Procurement. President Harry Truman rewarded his war service with the Legion of Merit. An active member of the Republican Party, he was instrumental in securing Dwight D. Eisenhower's nomination for the presidency in 1952. In 1957 Eisenhower appointed him to the 5th Circuit, which then included Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, as well as Louisiana. Wisdom aligned himself with three other 5th Circuit judges to form "The Four," a coalition that pressed consistently for black rights.</p><p>In 1977 Wisdom changed his status from active judge to senior judge, which relieved him of administrative duties but allowed him to continue to hear cases and write opinions. From 1975 until his death, he was a judge for the special court created under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. He received many accolades, including honorary degrees from Tulane, Harvard, and San Diego universities and Oberlin and Middlebury colleges. Despite his support for civil rights, Wisdom maintained his memberships in the all-white Boston Club and Louisiana Club, explaining, "I can't change their minds, and they can't change my mind. They respect me, and I probably help the situation a little by not getting out of those clubs."</p><p>Wisdom's association with those organizations may have stimulated his interest in the New Orleans Mardi Gras memorabilia found in the Judge John Minor Wisdom Collection. Mardi Gras has been commemorated in Louisiana at least since 1699. In the 1850s the celebration fell into disrepute, but on February 24, 1857, the Mistick Krewe of Comus staged its first street parade, giving rise to the New Orleans carnival that we know today. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, carnival organizations vied with each other to produce colorful, elaborately illustrated invitations to their balls and other ephemera.</p><p>Source: Pope, John.

p120701coll9	Lafcadio Hearn Correspondence	<p>Lafcadio Hearn was a writer during the closing decades of the nineteenth century and the opening years of the twentieth. His writings--fiction and nonfiction alike--typically drew on his firsthand observations of life in what were then considered exotic places: New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. The Lafcadio Hearn Collection at Loyola University New Orleans consists primarily of letters written by Hearn to Page Baker. Baker was the editor of the Times-Democrat when Hearn worked for that newspaper; he was also a steadfast champion of Hearn's literary ambitions. Hearn wrote Baker from various places--New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. In these letters, which ranged from one paragraph to many pages, Hearn touched on many subjects, including his work at the Times-Democrat, his literary efforts, and his travels. </p>

This corpus highlights Louisiana's strong cultural, linguistic, and social ties with France.</p><p> </p><p>The goal of this ongoing project is to enhance access to rare and understudied French documents held in the Special Collections by providing images of the original documents along with transcriptions in the Louisiana Digital Library. For the initial selection, Dr. Carole Salmon chose approximately 40 documents, mostly manuscripts, taking into consideration factors such as the author's profession and social status in France following the French Revolution.</p><p> </p><p>The French Revolution was an event of tremendous importance, and one which had profound impact on most of the world. Outside of Europe this was especially true of the French Caribbean colonies, and the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Many Louisianians felt a great attachment to France, and throughout the Spanish reign pushed to have the colony retroceded. After the revolution, particularly after the publication of Citizen Edmund Charles Genet's 1792 pamphlet calling for uprising (and promising French support), it looked as though those discontented with Spanish rule might have cause for celebration. Alas, though French revolutionary influence played a factor in several small revolts and demonstrations across the colony from New Orleans to Natchez, it did not lead to successful revolution, or force a retrocession from Spanish hands back to the French. Indeed, the colony did not retrocede until nearly a decade later in 1800.</p><p> </p><p>The Lettres de Louisiane collection demonstrates the depth of connection felt by many Louisianians to France. The French identifying people of New Orleans demonstrated in the streets during the years immediately following the Revolution. Songs were invented and plays staged that contained themes of popular uprising and even the execution of royals and the Spanish regime. At the same time, however, there were royalists and French refugees, particularly from the French colony of St. Dominque, taking up residence in the city as well. Fear of slave revolt, fresh in the memory of the St. Domingue refugees, had a chilling effect on the willingness of the French planters to throw their lot in with the agitators in the city.</p><p>Louisiana Early English Corpus</p><p>Early Louisiana French Correspondence</p>

LPC	Louisiana Purchase and Louisiana Colonial History	No description
lapur	Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Collection	<p></p><p> </p><p>The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 stands as the most significant event in the westward expansion of the United States and as an experiment to incorporate a substantially different culture. It was the beginning of the meeting of multi-cultural frontiers. The Louisiana Purchase changed what the United States had been and had a profound effect on what the United States would become. By 2003, this digital collection will provide materials for modern researchers - from the middle school student to the adult scholar or lifelong learner - to study the complex process of opening the West from the points of view of the diverse heritage, peoples, and cultures involved. Eventually more than 25,000 pages of materials will be made available through this project.</p><p>The new territories of the Louisiana Purchase presented a significant challenge to the primarily Anglo-Protestant, adolescent United States of America. The southernmost part of the Louisiana Purchase was in effect a foreign country. Many of its inhabitants were Mediterranean, Caribbean, and African in origin. Most were Catholic, spoke different languages, and had a different view of government, law, and race. Louisiana was a richly multi-cultural frontier in which different ethnic groups jostled for power and primacy. Creoles of French and Spanish descent, Germans upriver from New Orleans, English settlers in what would become the Florida parishes, Acadians to the west of the metropolis, free people of color, slaves, and Native Americans would interact with the new waves of "Americans" from states such as Tennessee and Kentucky. Indeed the Louisiana Purchase started the United States' encounter with diversity that has continued throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p>Then as now, diversity brought about conflicts, some of which ended in accommodation and the realization that from diversity comes strength. Most ethnic groups were distrustful of the others. Louisiana's history as a colony, territory, and state in the fifteen years from 1800 to 1815 was characterized by diplomatic, political, legal, and cultural friction and accommodation among the various elements of its diverse population. Included during the period were the following momentous events or movements: the Louisiana Purchase (1803); the creation of the Territory of Orleans (1804); a massive immigration of French, African slaves, and free people of color from Saint Domingue to New Orleans (1809); the largest slave revolt in U.S. history in St. Charles and St. John parishes (1811); statehood (1812); the Creek War (1813-14); and the Battle of New Orleans (1815). By the time of the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, at the end of the War of 1812, the national experiment in colonialism had become a success. The battle served as a means of uniting the inhabitants in a common cause. Soldiers from Tennessee and Kentucky fought alongside Creoles, Acadians, free men of color, and Choctaw Indians. The battle was a great military victory and the United States' most multi-ethnic endeavor to that time.</p><p>The materials in this collection consist of primary sources that document the heritage, peoples and cultures of the area that was to become the state of Louisiana during a critical and tumultuous period in its history, 1800-1815. These sources come from the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections of the Louisiana State University Libraries, and the New Orleans City Archives and Louisiana Collection of the New Orleans Public Library. The project is a partnership with these two libraries and the LSU Digital Library and has been funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.</p><p>The sources include books published in or about Louisiana during the period (with a few reminiscences of the period that were published later), including travel accounts, political tracts, and scientific and religious works. Materials also include maps ranging from original plans of Baton Rouge and New Orleans to sketchier depictions of the Louisiana frontier; pamphlets and government records and publications documenting the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, two pivotal events that frame the period; French-language pamphlets depicting society and commerce; and manuscripts. The manuscripts include letters and official documents of government officials and bodies, family papers of Louisiana residents, and accounts of travelers. Many of the documents deal with New Orleans, which was then the largest city in the South and the nation's second largest port. Others reflect events in the geographic area that would become the state of Louisiana in 1812, as well as the vast new western areas claimed by the United States. All the materials document the remarkable cultural and ethnic heritage of Louisiana during this period.</p>

The station’s purpose was "to develop and improve the agricultural interests and resources of Louisiana, especially the cultivation of sugarcane and rice by scientific and agricultural and chemical experiments and to disseminated information connected therewith." With the passage of the federal Hatch Act of 1887, agriculture research at land grant universities established throughout the US. Today, the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station serves as the research arm of the LSU AgCenter. It is composed of academic departments and research stations across Louisiana. Scientists at research stations develop new knowledge and technologies to help agricultural producers provide citizens of the state and the nation with a vast array of food, fiber, and fuel. More information about the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station can be found here: http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/administration/about_us/research/ </p><p> </p><p>The digitization of the LSU Agricultural Experiment Station bulletins was funded through Project Ceres, a program that supports the ongoing preservation and digitization of collections in the field of agriculture.

p16313coll28	Loyola University New Orleans University Photographs Collection	<p>The Loyola University New Orleans University Photographs Collection is comprised of photographs dating back to the early 20th century from Loyola's University Archives. Early photographs include some taken by famed New Orleans photographer E.J. Bellocq. Since 1949, the university has employed an official photographer. While a large part of the photographs in the collection come from these university employees, many photographs in the collection are unidentified. When the photographer is known, photos will be credited to that person. Unidentified photos will be credited to the university.</p><p> </p><p>Russ Cresson was the university photographer from 1949 to 1987. A native New Orleanian and a 1938 graduate of Warren Easton High School, Cresson served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. In 1946 he joined the wave of veterans entering Loyola on the GI Bill.  While pursuing a degree in business and playing on the Wolfpack baseball team, he began working as the unofficial university photographer, taking pictures for the yearbook and The Maroon and photographing campus and administrative activities.  When he graduated in 1949, Loyola hired him as its first full-time university photographer. In 1983 he received the Coadjutor Optimus, given annually to an outstanding member of the university staff, and in 2004 he received the Adjutor Hominum, which is presented by the alumni association to an outstanding alumnus.</p><p> </p><p>As an undergraduate, Tracy Smith served as assistant to Cresson, assuming the position of University Photographer after Cresson's retirement. Smith served as University Photographer from 1987-1989.</p><p> </p><p>In 1989 Harold Baquet became Loyola’s university photographer. He was born in Charity Hospital, grew up first in the Treme and then in the Seventh Ward, attended Corpus Christi school and church, and graduated from St. Augustine High School. As a young man he plunged into the profession as an independent photojournalist.  A few years later he became the official photographer to the Mayor of the City of New Orleans, a position he held from 1984 to 1989 under Ernest N. Morial and then Sidney J. Barthelemy. With the possible exception of the university president, no figure on campus is better known or more respected than Baquet.  Befitting his many contributions and his dedication to the university’s mission, Loyola presented him with two of its highest awards:  the Coadjutor Optimus in 2002 and the President’s Medal in 2010.</p><p> </p><p>Photographs from the Dr. Edward Wynne Photograph Collection are also included. Dr. Edward W. Wynne was an Arts & Science graduate of Loyola University in 1939. According to his son, Michael D. Wynne, Dr. Wynne was the school’s photographer during the late 1930s.</p>

LMP	Maps of Louisiana Collection	<p></p><p>This collection consists of historically important original maps associated with the French colonization of the territory of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Purchase. Maps included were created by Nicholas de Fer, Guillaume de L'Isle (1675-1726), Jacques Nicholas Bellin (1703-1772), Le Page du Pratz (d. 1775), Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville (1697-1782), Jan Jansson (1588-1664), Jean Baptiste Nolin (1686-1762), Guillaume Danet, William Faden (1750?-1836), Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598), and others. They are contained within LSU Libraries' Special Collections.Geographically, the maps trace the exploratory voyages of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville (1661-1706), beginning in France, continuing to Saint Domingiue, Cuba, the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, up the Mississippi River to the Village of Natchez, back to the Dry Tortugas, and con cluding with the Bahama Passage.Historically, these selected maps document the leading role of the French in deriving the first accurate maps of the New World. These voyages were part of the French effort to 1) accurately remeasure the shape of the globe from north to south, 2) systematically determine accurate longitudes from astronomical observations associated with the opening of the Paris observatory in 1672, and 3) explore the world. Because of this scientific undertaking, Guillaume de L'Isle is known as the first modern cartographer, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville is credited with facilitating European penetration of Africa and of North America through the Great Lakes, and Jacques Nicholas Bellin is associated with the first modern hydrographic surveys and sea-atlases of the world. (Skelton, 1958)As Louisiana is on the eve of the tricentennial of d'Iberville's founding of the colony of Louisiana, and near the eve of the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase, the presentation of these maps online is a timely contribution by Louisiana State University to the commemeration of these historical events. The maps are of immense ecological, historical, and social interest, and constitute a unique interdisciplinary online resource.The French Colonization of Louisiana and Louisiana Purchase Map Collection was coordinated and selected by Dr. Richard E. Condry, Associate Professor, Coastal Fisheries Institute, Louisiana State University.Visit the David Rumesy Collection to search for and view additional, historical maps.Skelton, R. A. 1958.

p16313coll37	Mesoamerican Painted Manuscripts at the Latin American Library	<p>The Latin American Library at Tulane University is home to one of the premier collections of original Mexican pictorial manuscripts found within the United States. These treasures, along with extensive holdings of rare books, other original manuscript collections, comprehensive holdings of facsimile editions of other codices, and other scholarly research materials and primary sources, distinguish it as one of the world’s foremost collections for the study of Mesoamerican writing systems and painted manuscripts, pre-Columbian culture, and early Colonial Mexican history and society.</p><p> </p><p>The digital collection, Mesoamerican Painted Manuscripts at the Latin American Library, presents images of the Library’s holdings of original and rare copies of Mexican manuscripts painted in the native pictorial tradition. They are painted on a variety of materials such as animal hide, maguey, amate or fig bark paper, linen, and European paper; their content dates to the early contact period (A.D. 1500 to 1700). The texts collected here represent a variety of themes: Aztec history and migrations, land claims and grants, property holdings, census data, fiscal and tribute accounts, and royal Mixtec genealogies.</p><p> </p><p>The early Contact period in Mexico was a time of rapid culture change, loss, and transformation during which much of pre-Columbian culture, particularly the arts, ideology, language, and religion, meshed with that of the Spanish colonists and the Roman Catholic clergy. The scribal tradition and writing systems of indigenous Mesoamerican civilizations also persisted and became amalgamated with the European scribal arts implanted along with the rest of Spanish colonial society.</p><p> </p><p>Prior to contact, Mesoamerican scribes were highly skilled intellectuals, craftsmen, and priests, who were literate and likely multilingual. Examples of their work that have survived from this period show that they were very adept at learning new languages and scripts, writing conventions, and meeting the distinct demands of a Western colonial society for secular written documents. The painted manuscripts in the Latin American Library’s collection presented here in digital form represent important dimensions of this syncretic process.</p><p> </p><p>La Biblioteca Latinoamericana de Tulane alberga una de las colecciones de manuscritos pictográficos originales mexicanos más importantes de los Estados Unidos. Estos tesoros, aunados a una notable colección de impresos raros y curiosos, manuscritos coloniales originales, ediciones facsimilares de otros códices, y otras fuentes primarias y secundarias hacen de esta colección una de las más significativas del mundo para el estudio de los sistemas de escritura y los manuscritos pictóricos indígenas mesoamericanos, así como de las culturas precolombinas y el período colonial mexicano en general.</p><p> </p><p>La colección Manuscritos pictóricos mesoamericanos de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana ofrece imágenes digitales de los manuscritos originales y copias facsimilares raras de estilo pictográfico de los indígenas de México central. Los manuscritos se remontan a los siglos XVI y XVII, y están dibujados en diversas superficies, como piel de venado, papel de maguey, amate, e higo, tela de lino, y papel europeo. Está representada gran variedad de temas: la historia azteca y sus migraciones; pleitos y concesiones de tierras; disposición de propiedades; censos; cuentas fiscales y de tributo; y genealogías reales de familias mixtecas.</p><p> </p><p>La llegada de los españoles a México inició una etapa de acelerados cambios, pérdidas, y transformaciones culturales. Fue durante esta etapa que gran parte de las culturas prehispánicas, sobre todo sus expresiones artísticas, ideologías, idiomas, y religiones se fundieron con la de los colonizadores y clérigos católicos europeos. La tradición escribana y los sistemas autóctonos de escritura de las civilizaciones mesoamericanas también perduraron, mezclándose con las tradiciones europeas que fueron implantadas con el resto de la cultura española colonial.</p><p> </p><p>Antes de la llegada de los españoles, los escribanos mesoamericanos ya se insertaban dentro de una notable tradición, desempeñándose como intelectuales de gran refinación, artesanos de alta calidad, y sacerdotes, todos letrados y probablemente plurilingües. Las muestras de sus obras que han sobrevivido hasta hoy demuestran que fueron muy hábiles para aprender idiomas y escrituras nuevas, incorporando convenciones de escrituras foráneas, para cumplir con las demandas de una sociedad occidental colonial en la producción de formas de escritura laicas. Los manuscritos que conserva la Biblioteca Latinoamericana y presentados aquí en forma digital representan dimensiones importantes de este complejo proceso de sincretismo.</p><p> </p><p>This collection is best viewed with a browser other than Firefox.

p16313coll15	Mexican Incunabula (1559-1600) at the Latin American Library	<p>The first printing press in the New World is established in Mexico City in 1539. Because printing was concevied by the Spaniards as a tool for missionaries in the Christianization of Indian populations, these early imprints consisted primarily of grammars and vocabularies of native Indian languages, as well as instructional religious tracts. This collection provides digitized images of some of the earliest products of Mexican printing presses (1539-1600). In addition to making available some of the earliest imprints produced in the New World, this collection provides important and rare sources for the study of the first phases of the Spanish enterprise in the New World, as well as initial forms of encounter between Native Americans and Europeans. These works also provide valuable insights into native languages and cultures during the first decades of contact. Early Mexican imprints are quite rare, and the Latin American Library houses nine of these titles. The total number of pages is approximately 2600. The texts are in Spanish, Purépecha and Nahuatl.</p><p>The Mexican Incunabula at the Latin American Library (1559-1600) collection represents the Latin American Library’s contribution to a larger project called Impresos Mexicanos del Siglo XVI initiated by a small group of institutions in the United States and Mexico. The goal of the project is to create an on-line digital collection of early Mexican imprints that will include at least one copy of the existing 136 titles and as many additional versions of each as possible. The Primeros Libros de las Américas collection available at http://www.primeroslibros.org continues to grow as partner institutions join the project.</p><p> </p><p>En 1539, se estableció  la primera imprenta del Nuevo Mundo en México.  Dado que los españoles consideraban la imprenta como instrumento para la evangelización de los pueblos indígenas, estos primeros impresos consistían principalmente en gramáticas y vocabularios de idiomas nativos y tratados didácticos religiosos.  La colección Mexican Incunabula at the Latin American Library (1559-1600)[Impresos Incunables Mexicanos (1559-1600) de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana] ofrece copias digitales en formato pdf de estos primeros productos de la imprenta  mexicana (1539-1600).  Además de hacer disponibles en forma digital algunos de los primeros impresos del Nuevo Mundo, esta colección representa una fuente indispensable para el estudio de la primera fase de la empresa española en el Nuevo Mundo.  Estas obras ofrecen también valiosos aportes sobre los primeros contactos entre indígenas y europeos, y también sobre las culturas e idiomas indígenas en estas primeras décadas.  Los  incunables mexicanos son obras sumamente raras.  De los 220  títulos identificados, se han identificado apenas 136 títulos en repositorios del mundo entero.   Nueve de estos impresos se encuentran en el acervo de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana.  En total, estos nueve incunables contienen aproximadamente 2.600 páginas.  Los textos están en español, purépecha, y náhuatl.</p><p>Esta colección también representa la contribución de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana al proyecto llamado Impreso Mexicanos del Siglo XVI que se realizó un grupo de siete instituciones en los Estados Unidos y México. El objetivo definitivo del proyecto es construir una colección digital accesible por Internet de los primeros impresos mexicanos, y que consistirá por lo menos un ejemplar de cada impresión única sobreviviente y las cuantas copias sea posible.  Se encuentra la colección de Primeros Libros de las Américas con la url: http://www.primeroslibros.org.</p><p>This collection is best viewed with a browser other than Firefox.

LSU_MRF	Mississippi River Flood of 1927 Photograph Album	<p>The Mississippi River Flood of 1927 Album is a visual record of one of the worst natural disasters to occur in the U. S. The flood took the lives of thousands, made refugees of hundreds of thousands, and caused vast destruction. The photo album was prepared for O. K. Allen (1882-1936), Chairman, Louisiana Highway Commission and later Governor, and presumably used for securing Federal disaster aid. This album became the property of George Cobb Everett (1885-1946) who served on the LSU Board Supervisors and was member of the committee sent to Washington, D. C. in 1927 to secure federal funds for rebuilding destroyed roads and bridges. Most of the photographs are identified as the work of Baton Rouge photographer Jasper G. Ewing. Some of the photographs were published in the Fourth Biennial Report of the Louisiana Highway Commission of the State of Louisiana, 1926-1928 (TE 24 L8A2).The album contains 214 black and white photographs showing flood damage to roads, bridges, and buildings primarily in the Atchafalaya River region and the town of Melville, Louisiana. The photos include depictions of repair crews, levees, barges, crevasses, and railroads. Some photos pre-date the flood and a few depict scenes from non-flooded areas. The album includes a photostatic copy of the first check for one-half the amount of federal disaster money paid to Louisiana and a newspaper clipping concerning Louisiana's implementation of the first gasoline tax. </p>

MSW	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	<p> </p><p>The Native Flora of Louisiana Collection contains watercolor drawings by world-renowned botanical artist Margaret Stones. The collection began in 1976, when Louisiana State University commissioned six watercolor drawings to celebrate the American bicentennial and the 50th anniversary of LSU's Baton Rouge campus (Stones xv; Zdanowicz 15). University officials hoped these drawings would combine art and science to create a "record of Louisiana's lush, varied, and beautiful flora" (Stones xv).  Based on the popularity of the original six drawings, LSU decided to expand the Native Flora of Louisiana project to include 200 more drawings. Stones completed these drawings in 1987, and she continued to produce drawings on a yearly contract basis until 1989. The Native Flora of Louisiana project currently numbers 224 drawings, all of which are housed in LSU Libraries Special Collections Hill Memorial Library along with other published works by Stones (Stones ix-xv).

p15140coll39	Newcomb College Scrapbooks	<p>Scrapbooks inhabit an uneasy place in the world of print. Unique artifacts created most often from mass-produced text and images, they often find no comfortable resting place in the private home, the selves of libraries, or the boxes of archives.  Digital imaging make scrapbooks accessible from disparate locations but also provide in many ways an easier way of handling bulky pages filled to the brim with documents. </p><p> </p><p>Newcomb College long preserved some of the scrapbooks of its students in a vault on the historic women's campus. The scrapbooks today form one of the cornerstones to the Newcomb Archives and especially show the trajectories of lives in the period 1900-1945.  The women sought to document diverse experiences. While no two albums are alike, the majority of the collection covers topics such as college athletics, plays and films, the city of New Orleans, social life, and academics.  In addition, various albums such as that of Mary Jane Conover and Anne Crichton document travel while those of other scrapbook makers preserve memorabilia from summer camps, debutante parties, weddings, and political marches. </p>

The 249-acre exposition opened late and already in debt, while the exhibits were not all completed until March 1885. The Main Building, the largest exhibit building on the grounds and the largest wooden structure in the world at the time, held exhibits from 30 countries. The Government & States Building hosted exhibits from 45 states and territories, as well as U.S. Government exhibits occupying one third of the floor space.</p><p> </p><p>Horticultural Hall, housing the horticultural and agricultural displays and constructed entirely of glass and wood, was the world's largest structure of its type. The Art Hall opened in February 1885 and proved a success with critics. A total of 1,158,840 visitors were counted as having entered the grounds, far below the estimated 4 million that had been projected. The exposition closed $470,000 in debt. </p><p> </p><p> This collection consists of 65 stereoscopic photographs of exhibition buildings, exhibit booths, and other city buildings taken during the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition held in New Orleans, La., in 1884-1885.

p16313coll68	NOLA Hip Hop and Bounce Archive	<p>List of Artists</p><p> </p><p>For more than three decades now, hiphop and bounce music traditions in New Orleans have been central outlets for creativity, celebration, social critique, community gathering, and political and expressive art in the city. From the groundbreaking, internationally recognized Cash Money and No Limit record labels to the strong currents of underground hiphop and street rap that sustain the tradition, New Orleans has been a recognized hiphop locale since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the indigenous New Orleans bounce music tradition, born at block parties, dance clubs, and other community gatherings, had until very recently been little heard outside the city. Since Hurricane Katrina, bounce has become a force of its own, gaining massive popularity and influence internationally via artists like Big Freedia, Katey Red and Nicky da B (1990-2014), though its roots go back well over two decades.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps more audibly so than rappers anywhere else in America, New Orleans artists have pulled from the musical traditions of the city’s past. Far from rejecting the musical and cultural traditions of earlier generations, early New Orleans rappers in particular often incorporated elements of them––including brass-band street-parade instrumentations/rhythms and Mardi Gras Indian chants and melodies––into the hip-hop collage. Today, rap music is Louisiana’s most lucrative cultural export. But in the most widespread images of “New Orleans music,” the city’s incredibly influential and successful rappers, producers and DJs that helped to build the tradition remain largely invisible. This, coupled with the realities of Hurricane Katrina, in which countless members of the city’s creative communities lost their lives or were displaced, many of whom remain unable to return, inspired a determination in many to help provide resources/further acknowledgment for artists and to document/collect hiphop and bounce oral histories and ephemera. The NOLA Hiphop and Bounce Archive hopes to be one of many initiatives assisting in such efforts. As the nation’s oldest, largest, and arguably most comprehensive independent archives/library documenting the modern Civil Rights Movement, the Amistad Research Center is playing a central role in helping to facilitate the development and growth of this collection. While the collection hopes to expand to include further materials from a variety of artists, collectors, and collaborators in the near future, the NOLA Hiphop and Bounce Archive collection launches with materials from the Where They At bounce and hip-hop collection and the NOLA Hiphop Archive. </p><p> </p><p>The Where They At project was begun in 2008 by photographer Aubrey Edwards and journalist Alison Fensterstock, with the assistance of a grant from the Greater New Orleans Foundation. It collects over 50 photographic portraits and audio interviews with New Orleans rappers, DJs, producers, photographers, label owners, promoters, record store personnel, journalists and other parties involved in the New Orleans hip-hop and bounce scene from the late 1980’s through Hurricane Katrina, as well as ephemera including original fliers, posters, vintage photographs and an extensive collection of record, CD and cassette tape scans. In a multimedia exhibition form, Where They At was presented at the Smithsonian-affiliated Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Austin’s Birdhouse Gallery and SXSW festival, Minneapolis’ Soap Factory, New York City’s Abrons Art Center and the Direktorenhaus in Berlin, Germany.</p><p> </p><p>The NOLA Hiphop Archive was founded by Holly Hobbs in 2012. To date, the NOLA Hiphop Archive has focused on the recording and collection of digital videotaped oral histories. The collection currently contains over 40 videotaped interviews with leading hiphop and bounce artists, with new interviews added on an ongoing basis. We are thankful to the donors to our Kickstarter and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation for their generous support.</p><p> </p><p>Students, teachers, researchers, and others are encouraged to contact the Center about this digital collection and related materials.

p16313coll42	Print Culture of the Civil Rights Movement, 1950-1980	<p>The Civil Rights Movement in the United States coincided with rapid changes in a variety of news and communications media. The expansion of television and documentary filmmaking brought images of the struggles of African Americans and those who supported civil rights into the homes of the American populace. However, control of the tone and content of electronic media was not always in the hands of those who were being documented. It was the democratization of various printed media that allowed civil rights leaders, workers, and organizations to circulate their combined, and sometimes contradictory, voices.</p><p> </p><p>This digital collection is an expansion of the exhibition The Revolution Will Not Be...: Print Culture of the Civil Rights Movement held at the Amistad Research Center in 2011.

p15140coll34	Registre Du Comite Medical De La Nouvelle Orleans, 1816-1854	<p>The Registre du Comite Medical de la Nouvelle Orleans is the record of the Eastern Board's (Comite Medical) work of examination and licensing of qualified physicians, surgeons, pharmacists and midwives from 1816 to 1854. The manuscript consists of 230 pages including an index of the names of the approximately 1200 people who came before the Comite Medicale petitioning for the right to practice medicine in Louisiana. As such, it is of interest to genealogists as well as medical historians. Even though it has an index it is somewhat cumbersome to use as the text of the document is handwritten in French. The names in the index are also handwritten and the user must search through all names that begin with a certain letter to locate names, as the names are not in alphabetical order. In order to find a specific entry, it is necessary to identify the proper page number from the personal name index, go to the page number index, display the page and read/print the appropriate entry.</p><p>A Review of Licensing Provisions in Louisiana, and the Significance of the Registre du Comite Medical de la Nouvelle Orleans. Postell, William D., Sr. Typescript. Tulane Medical Library History Collection. No date. </p><p> Louisiana has consistently exercised more control over the practice of medicine than the Eastern seaboard states. During the Colonial period there were laws regulating the practice of medicine which were far in advance of their times. Between 1803 to 1812 the Territorial legislature enacted laws governing the practice of medicine and pharmacy, and these laws were surprisingly progressive. In 1816-17 the State revised the medical legislation establishing two medical licensing boards, one for the Eastern and Western districts of the State. Until 1852 these laws with some modification remained in effect. The 1816 measure provided both fines and imprisonment for anyone practicing medicine without a license. This law provided some check on the rise of quackery.</p><p> The 1816 law established a medical licensing board consisting of four physicians and one apothecary in New Orleans. Its first activity was to record it activities faithfully for 36 years of its existence. It also acted as a State Board of Health. This record was known as the Registre du Comite Medical de la Nouvelle Orleans, and this record is held in the Rudolph Matas Library of Tulane University. </p><p>In 1817 a second examining board was established known as the Western district. It was designated to hold meetings in Opelousas and Alexandria. The Eastern district was renamed, and its membership increased to six. In 1820 a law was enacted by declaring anyone with a regular medical degree could obtain a license without examination. The Western district was less effective, but the results of their meeting were recorded in the Notarial records at the Parish Court House where it met. </p>

She was primarily self-educated with only a few months of formal schooling at a nearby convent. De la Houssaye began a school in the Franklin area and also worked as the postmistress. She wrote stories and poetry for her eight grandchildren whom she raised after her daughter died young.  De la Houssaye wrote short stories and novelettes set primarily in St. Mary and St. Martin parishes, areas between Lafayette and New Orleans, about plantation life, manners of the Creoles and their attitudes toward Acadians and Americans. The stories are of interest for their rendition of Cajun and Negro French dialects. The story plots are simple, designed to appeal to plantation women and convent educated girls. She also wrote morality tales for the education and character training of her eight grandchildren. She wrote in French only to encourage her grandchildren to maintain the dialect and be cognizant of their Creole heritage.  De la Houssaye sold at least three of her stories to the popular American author and New Orleans native George Washington Cable for his book, Strange True Stories of Louisiana. Letters from de la Houssaye to Cable during their six year correspondence are available in the George Washington Cable Papers at Tulane University.  Although not widely celebrated during her lifetime, Sidonie de la Houssaye was later recognized as a Louisiana French writer of distinction in Les Ecrits de Langue Francaise en Louisiana au XIX Siècle. Her works have been the subject of two dissertations completed at LSU, "A Critical Study of the Life and Writings of Sidonie de la Houssaye with Special Emphasis on the Unpublished Works (1966)" by Joseph John Perret and "Liminality in Gender, Race, and Nation in Les Quarteronnes de la Nouvelle-Orléans by Sidonie de la Houssaye (2006)" by Christine Koch Harris. </p><p>FINDING AID</p><p> LSU Libraries Special Collections</p>

The original sheet music is housed at LSU Libraries' Special Collections Library.</p><p> </p>
p16313coll46	Social Framework - Photographs by Marion Palfi, 1945-1960	<p>Social Framework: Photographs by Marion Palfi, 1945-1960, is a collection of photographs taken by Marion Palfi, a member of the New York Photo League. This collection captures a diverse spectrum of the American population and daily life from the end of the Second World War to 1960. Palfi often chose to go where other photographers either did not go, or where they could not gain access. In so doing, Palfi used her camera to study society and document people who were often "forgotten" by mainstream society, but never-the-less constituted part of the American social fabric. Therefore, aspects of social and economic life from the mid-1940s to the 1960s that were not presented in textbooks or other media during that period, are represented in the photos. For example, the collection features African American servicemen in uniform, as well as photographs of African Americans working in a wartime factory plant. </p><p>The economic disparity in the lives of the working class is evident in images of people waiting in line for jobs at an employment office, and in images of dilapidated housing in poor neighborhoods. The daily lives of southern African Americans is captured in photos of farming, church schools, laborers, and country scenes. Evidence of the racial discrimination African Americans endured at the hands of Jim Crow are imprinted on photographs of "Whites Only" segregation signs appearing on storefronts. In addition to Southern scenes, New York's Harlem neighborhood is also displayed prominently. Photographs of Harlem buildings and residents, as well as of building entrances, including the now defunct Sydenham Hospital, were immortalized by Palfi's lens.</p>
p16313coll66	Sounding Translation	<p>Sounding Translation is an Internet-accessible interview series that publicly archives translators’ reflections on the experience of translating contemporary poetry through audio interviews with the producer and host, Teresa Villa-Ignacio. It is an ongoing digitized oral history project that traces the development of relationships of exchange and collaboration among American poet-translators and their international peers working in languages including Arabic French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. As such, it complements Teresa Villa-Ignacio’s book manuscript-in-progress: Poethical Import: Translationships in Contemporary French-American Poetic Exchange. Sounding Translation raises awareness about the role of translators in the dissemination of literature and the importance of translation as a literary endeavor.</p>
p16313coll64	Sounds of Louisiana	<p>Contibute your sounds to this collection! Submit your files and metadata using our form.</p><p> </p><p>New Orleans and the surrounding region offer a plethora of sounds that are culturally, geographically, and architecturally unique to the region. Among many other things, this collection serves as an auditory historical marker of the changing city, for as the city-scape changes, so do the sounds. This collection originates with the work of a group of sound artists actively creating new sound art in New Orleans. The earliest record of the phrase “sound art” dates from 1983 with William Hellerman’s curated exhibition Sound/Art at New York’s Sculpture Center. Although sound art became more prevalent in the 1990s, this art form has a number of much earlier antecedents. The earliest conceptualizations of noise as music were by the Italian futurist Luigi Russolo, who developed several noise machines between 1913 and 1921 and authored the “Futurist Manifesto” in which he wrote “...we delight much more in combining in our thoughts the noises of trams, of automobile engines, of carriages, and brawling crowds, than in hearing again the “Eroica” or the “Pastorale”(The Art of Noises, p. 25).” </p><p>In 1920, Erik Satie took this concept a step further with two performances of Musique d’ameublement, in which repetitive musical fragments were to be played as a backdrop (as if time repeats itself) while the audience participated in the performance through their movements across the performance space and conversation (thus representing the continuation of time). Perhaps the most commonly known precursor to sound art is musique concrète, developed in 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer. Musique concrète describes a style of composition in which composers re-use portions of existing recordings or make new recordings of sounds from the world around them (e.g. the sound made by a car crossing a specific bridge) and recombine them in a number of variations and alterations to create a new piece of music. Sound art, although still loosely defined, generally combines values and techniques from each of these earlier musical forms. As in musique concrète, existing recordings as well as field recordings of sounds captured in the local environment may be used as primary concepts of the work either in their original form or electronically altered. Similarly, like the work of Satie, sound art also includes some visual component (painting, photographic, film, sculpture, etc.) and the audience’s experience of sound, visual, and space is often considered an intrinsic part of the work. </p><p>The sounds collected here are the field recordings of local sound artists, students, and faculty at Tulane University. While they were collected for possible integration into sound art and musical compositions, the sounds collected here more broadly represent an auditory history of New Orleans and the surrounding region, and may be linked to the streets, buildings, and neighborhoods of New Orleans and the surrounding region of the early 21st century. As such, these sounds have historical, cultural, architectural, and geographic significance. Although some sounds in this collection may be restricted in their use, many will be available for download and re-use under creative commons licenses.</p><p> </p>

Tensas	Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge Ivory Billed Woodpecker Records	<p></p><p>This collection is comprised of 100 photographic prints documenting 6 field seasons during the years 1935-1941 when James T. Tanner and associates studied the ivory-billed woodpecker and its environment on the Singer Tract, Madison Parish, Louisiana, in what is now the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge. Also included is Tanner's hand-drawn, two-sided map documenting nesting sites and other signs of the ivory-billed woodpecker's presence in the Singer and Ayer Tracts, Madison Parish.In 1935, a team of Cornell scientists - including Arthur A. Allen, Peter Paul Kellogg, George Miksch Sutton, J.J. Kuhn, and James T. Tanner - located three ivory-billed woodpecker nests in the Singer Tract. The researchers spent several days closely monitoring one of the nests and produced the first motion pictures and sound recordings ever obtained of the species. From 1937 to 1941, James Tanner (1914-1991) spent a large portion of his time living in the Singer Tract, collecting information about the ivory-billed woodpecker. Tanner used the data for his Cornell doctoral dissertation, which the Audubon Society later published in the Research report of the National Audubon Society, number 1, 1942. In 1941, Tanner and his wife, Nancy Burnham Sheedy Tanner, saw several ivory-billed woodpeckers at the Singer Tract. That same year, the National Audubon Society launched a campaign to preserve the Singer Tract as a refuge for ivory-billed woodpeckers. Tanner taught at East Tennessee State University from 1940, before serving in the Navy during World War II, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. From 1947 until retirement in 1979, he was at the University of Tennessee. Tanner did not return to the area until the 1980s, when the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge officially opened. </p>

LSU_TJP	Thomas H. and Joan W. Gandy Photograph Collection	<p>This digital collection contains a small sample of the Dr. Thomas H. and Joan Gandy collection which documents 100 years of history in and around Natchez, Mississippi. The physical collection contains approximately 20,000 images including wet and dry collodion glass plate negatives, film negatives, ferrotypes, and historic and modern prints as well as nearly 100 pieces of photographic equipment, including a Norman Studio portrait camera and an array of late-19th and early-20th century cameras. All are housed at LSU Libraries Special Collections in Hill Memorial Library.</p><p>Photographic History</p><p>Brothers Henry and M. J. Gurney established a daguerreotype studio in Natchez in 1851 and began recording the lives of their fellow citizens using the latest in photographic technology. The Civil War brought economic disaster and social upheaval to the region, but Natchez quickly recovered. In 1870, Henry Gurney hired a new employee, Henry Norman, and by 1876 Norman had opened his own studio, buying out Gurney's studio to do so. Henry Norman became the best-known photographer in the region. When he died in 1913, his son Earl inherited the studio. Earl, like his father, became widely known for his photographic skills and left images spanning nearly 40 years. </p>

p15140coll7	University of New Orleans Senior Honors Theses	<p>ATTENTION: This collection covers Honors Theses submitted through Summer 2011. Theses submitted from Fall 2011-present are available at http://scholarworks.uno.edu/honors_theses/.</p><p></p><p>The University of New Orleans Honors Program is designed to challenge academically astute students, offer a curriculum that will prepare them for success in their respective fields, and reward those motivated and competitive enough to achieve high academic goals. Besides earning the distinction that accompanies academic success, honors students participate in small, challenging classes taught by select faculty. They also have the opportunity to contract with professors of regular classes to receive honors credit by fulfilling additional academic requirements. The senior honors thesis requirement allows students to immerse themselves in advanced independent study, utilizing the experience and guidance of their thesis adviser.</p><p></p><p> To qualify for membership, first semester freshmen must have a composite ACT score of 26 (with at least a 27 in English), or be invited by the Honors Director. Continuing or transfer students may also qualify with a 3.25 cumulative GPA. Students maintain their Honors status based on academic performance. </p><p></p><p> As students pursue their various degrees, they must satisfactorily complete 30 hours of honors credit.These may be taken as special honors classes (listed in the bulletin), or contracted honors classes ("Honors Options"). The only required Honors classes are these: Arts and Sciences 1119, an exploration of Greek literature and philosophy; and ENGL 1159, which satisfies the English composition requirement, or ENGL 2279, which fulfills a literature requirement. (A&S 1119 counts as a social science or humanities elective, and it must be taken concurrently with either of the Honors English courses.) These courses should be taken in a student's first or second semester. As seniors, Honors students must complete an Honors thesis. This involves registering for six hours of Honors thesis credit, three to be taken in each of the last two semesters. A student will typically choose an adviser and begin research in the next-to-last undergraduate semester and complete the written portion in the last semester under the direction of the chosen adviser and the director of the Honors Program. Successful completion of these requirements allows a student to graduate with University and Departmental Honors. </p><p></p><p> Access to the theses in this collection is "restricted" by the Honors Program. Descriptive metadata is available to all, but the item is only available to users on the UNO campus.

UNO_SCC	UNO Historical Archives of the Supreme Court of Louisiana	<p>Historical Note</p><p>The Supreme Court of Louisiana holds the distinction of  being the state's highest court, or, as it is often called, the court of  last resort in Louisiana.  By order of the Court on November 4, 1976,  its historical archives-defined as those records created from the  Court's inception in 1813, when Louisiana's first state constitution  became effective, through 1920-were deposited in the Earl K. Long  Library at the University of New Orleans "to ensure their preservation  and safety."</p><p> </p><p>The archives consist mainly of manuscript case files  appealed from lower state courts to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.   Occupying approximately 2,730 linear feet, case files range in extent  from several pages to thousands of pages.  Rules required that the Court  be provided with a complete transcript of lower court files and  evidence; thus the case files include maps, surveys, printed briefs, and  a host of other documentation.  Often these are the only extant copies,  not only of appellate arguments and decisions, but also of records that  originated with lower courts, for many lower-court copies have been  lost to fire, theft, and age-related deterioration.</p><p> </p><p>Case files include a small number of legal documents,  dating between 1769 and 1812, which were used as exhibits or in  transcripts, and dockets for some cases which were "unreported", meaning  that the opinion was not published in Louisiana Reports.  Supplementing  these case files are docket books, which serve as a sort of index to  the case files, and minute books, which summarize particular cases and  record the Court's disposition of them.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the winter and spring sessions held in New  Orleans, until 1894 the Supreme Court met elsewhere in the state during  the summer and fall, at times in Opelousas, Alexandria, Baton Rouge,  Monroe, Natchitoches, and Shreveport.  Each location maintained its own  docket-numbering system.  Several times, coinciding with new state  constitutions, one numbering system was discontinued and another was  begun.  Many case files, docket books, and minute books for Court  sessions held outside New Orleans are missing.  Since 1898 the Court has  held its sessions only in New Orleans.</p><p> </p><p>Research Tips</p><p> </p><p>One of the easiest ways to locate a relevant case, available  on most campuses, is LexisNexis Academic's Legal Research.  On the main  page of "LexisNexis Academic", click on the "Legal" navigational tab at  the top of the page, then click "Federal & State Cases" on the  navigation links along the right-hand side of the page.  To further  narrow your search, select "LA Federal & State Cases, Combined" from  the drop-down menu next to "Sources", expand "Show options to search  specific document sections", select "Court" from the drop-down menu next  to "Section", and type in "Louisiana High Court".  To ensure that only  the years covered by UNO's holdings are searched, enter "1812" and  "1921" as the date range under "Specify Date".</p><p> </p><p>Researchers should note that not all of the court's opinions  were published.  For example, if the judges applied well-established  principles to a case with no novel facts, they did not bother to publish  the opinion as it had no value as a precedent.  But what is of little  interest to the lawyer might be of great interest to the historian or  anthropologist.  The files of these "unreported" cases are a potential  gold mine, but accessing them can be difficult as there is no published  reference to them, other than the list of "Cases Not Reported" in the  front of the annual legal reports after 1865.  Besides the annual  reports, researchers may consult the docket indexes to the New Orleans  sessions to discover these cases involving individuals, companies or  institutions from that portion of the state.  Thomas C. Manning's  Unreported Cases Heard and Determined by the Supreme Court of Louisiana,  from January 8, 1877, to April, 1880, Digested, Reported, and Condensed  (St. Louis: Nixon-Jones Printing Co., 1884), a copy of which is in the  Dart Collection (Mss 140), is another useful source.</p><p> </p><p>Researchers using the collection to study various  historical and cultural topics should keep in mind that this is a  collection of materials related to law and should familiarize  them-selves with the precise legal vocabulary used by the court.  For  example, historians interested in placage, the antebellum practice of  white men keeping a black mistress, will not find any cases if they  search for "placage" in LexisNexis.

p16313coll58	William Barth Photographs of Mississippi and Atchafalaya River operations	<p></p><p> </p><p>The photographs in the William Barth Papers, 1917-1959 Series I “Engineering and Levee Revetment documents, ca. 1925-1959” contain the subseries “Photographs of levee work, ca. 1928-1945.” The nearly 250 images depict various stages and types of work on the levees of the lower Mississippi River and Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin. Most of the larger photographs (9.5x6.5 inches) involve revetment of the levees on the Mississippi River from around Natchez down to the New Orleans area. Various revetment types (including those using wood, concrete, and asphalt) appear in this series. Also depicted are the procurement of loess and sand for various construction projects on the river. The smaller photographs show levees in the Atchafalaya Basin being built; many of these include photographs of heavy machinery such as excavation towers, elevating graders, and Caterpillar tractors.</p><p> </p><p>Biographical Note</p><p>William Barth was born in New York City on December 22, 1898 to German immigrants. Barth worked for the Interstate Commerce Commission, traveling from Maine to Florida to survey railroad tracks. In 1928 he took a position with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Natchez, Mississippi. For thirty years he worked on flood control of both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers and helped with major projects such as the Bonnet Carre Spillway. During World War II he received a commendation for meritorious civilian service since he helped control flood waters that could have damaged crops and held back war production. He died February 17, 1982.</p><p> </p><p>View the collection finding aid.</p>
p15140coll19	William Branks Stewart Collection	<p>William Branks Stewart was a medical artist for Louisiana State University  Medical School - New Orleans from 1933 until his untimely death of a heart attack in 1950. During his time as head of the medical arts department, Mr. Stewart gained national recognition for his work in the field of medical illustration, specifically for his use of an airbrush to produce medical illustrations. A 1946 article from the New Orleans Times-Picayune offers this description: </p><p> </p><p>For 13 years Mr. Stewart has been recording in picture form the details of surgical operations, disease processes and bone fractures for the local medical school. These illustrative art works are used for museum demonstrations, in textbooks, in medical journals and as teaching aids for class work of medical students.  Mr. Stewart not only paints but also draws and makes plaster molds. He takes photographs through microscopes and down such complicated devices as the bronchoscope-which is used to see inside a person's windpipe, bronchial tubes and lungs. When a surgeon suddenly finds something at an operation which he wishes to record or publish, a rush call is made for drawings or photographs. Sometimes a patient presents a rare condition at one of the clinics and Mr. Stewart is called over immediately. Some weeks he attends as many as five operations. Requests for him are frequently made by surgeons with new techniques that they want recorded. At the medical school, Mr. Stewart has four rooms full of mysterious gadgets which, to the uninitiated eye of the layman, appear like a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions.</p><p> </p><p>A native of Airdrie, Scotland, Mr. Stewart studied art at Glasgow School of Art before moving to America in 1925 to take a job at Northwestern  University dental school. In 1933 he moved to New Orleans to work for LSU Medical  School. In addition, he painted landscapes as a hobby. A member of the New Orleans Art league, his portraits and landscapes were exhibited in the Art League's annual exhibit, and in 1941 he presented a one-man show at the Delgado Museum (now the New Orleans Museum of Art). Mr. Stewart was a fixture during the early years of LSU Medical School, regularly providing illustrations for The Tiger, the school's student newspaper. A 1934 interview with a Tiger reporter reveals his sense of humor: </p><p></p><p>Why did I study art? To make big money? Am I making it? To dodge work? Am I dodging it? Have I failed? No, I am doing something I enjoy, among people I enjoy, and in what I consider to be the most interesting city in America. So what the h---. </p><p></p><p>Mr. Stewart's collection of airbrushed and pen and ink medical art was found in the LSU Health Sciences Center Archives during renovations in 2009, and is now available in digital format for public view.</p><p> </p><p>Visitors with more information about Mr. William Branks Stewart or any of these images are encouraged to contact digitalarchives@lsuhsc.edu, so we may further add to the collection.</p>

Clerk of the U.S. Army (c.1945) is the only manuscript to have survived from this period, according to a handwritten note in the collection that details that he burned most of them because of his desire to be considered a ‘serious’ composer.</p><p>After his PhD from the University of Southern California, Thornton held many appointments as a music educator before landing at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, where he spent the majority of his professional career. In 1980, he earned the prestigious title of Professor Emeritus at Trinity University and after his retirement in 1988, he accepted a lecturer position in music composition at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p><p>Thornton was a prolific composer and created works for a wide range of mediums including film, musicals, and one electronic piece title ‘Water Tower Music’ for Electro-Magnetic Tape (1984). He has received numerous awards including first prize in the 1945 National Federation of Music Clubs Young Composers Contest for his Sonatina for Violin and Piano (1944), the Performance Award of the Symposium of Western Composers, and the Carolyn Alchin Award to study composition with Pulitzer Prize-winner Roger Sessions.</p><p>The William J. Thornton Papers (1939-1998) consist primarily of manuscripts, acetate record discs, and cassette and reel-to-reel audio and video tape recordings.
